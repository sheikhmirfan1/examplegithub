                I'm passionate about cutting-edge technologies and scuba diving.
                I love to discover and learn new things.
              </h3>
            
            <p class="intro">
              I'm Italian, I was born in Rome where I lived, studied and worked
              until I moved to Berlin in 2007. I studied sociology and media
              anthropology at Rome's University "La Sapienza". I have a
              Communication Sciences Bachelor's degree from Rome's University
              "Tor Vergata", where I graduated with a thesis in informatics
              about the privacy concerns and implications of web applications
              security.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have 2 young children. I love pizza (who doesn't ?!), cooking,
              traveling, attend live concerts and watch documentary about
              history and science. My favourite travel destination so far is
              Southeast Asia. I speak Italian, English and German. Since 2018 I
              have a dual-citizenship: Italian / German
